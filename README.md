Project Description

This project uses the Iris dataset to explain and show how dimensionality reduction techniques work in machine learning. The Iris dataset contains information about three types of flowers and has four features for each flower. In this project, those four features are reduced to two dimensions so the data can be easily visualized and understood.

The main goal of this project is to apply and compare three methods: PCA, t-SNE, and LDA. These methods help us understand how data can be simplified without losing important information. The project also shows how the same dataset can look different when different techniques are used.

This project is useful for beginners who want to learn data visualization and dimensionality reduction using Python.
